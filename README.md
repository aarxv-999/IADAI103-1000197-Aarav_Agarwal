# MindPatch – AI-Assisted Digital Detox & Wellness Planner

## Project Overview
**MindPatch** is a user-centered, AI-assisted digital wellness planner designed for students and young adults who experience digital fatigue, excessive screen time, and emotional overload in a hyperconnected environment.  
The app promotes mindful technology use by encouraging emotional self-awareness, healthy digital habits, and gentle detox routines through a calm, supportive interface.

This project was developed as part of the **Critical and Creative Thinking (CRS) – Artificial Intelligence** summative assessment, focusing on human-centered design, ethical AI simulation, and usability-driven iteration.

## Problem Statement
Students today spend a significant portion of their day on digital devices, often leading to screen fatigue, stress, and reduced emotional well-being. Existing solutions either feel overwhelming, overly technical, or lack personalization. There is a need for a simple, emotionally supportive digital tool that helps users reflect on their mood, monitor screen usage, and receive personalized detox suggestions without causing guilt or pressure.

## Target Users
- Students and young adults (ages 16–24)
- Individuals experiencing:
  - High daily screen time
  - Mental fatigue or distraction
  - Difficulty maintaining healthy digital habits

## User Flow Overview
**Onboarding → Home Dashboard → Mood Logging → Screen-Time Input → AI Detox Planner → Habit Tracker → Gratitude Journal → Home Dashboard**

This flow mirrors a real wellness routine: emotional check-in, behavioral awareness, guided suggestion, and positive reinforcement.

## AI Logic (Simulated – No Real AI Model)

The AI functionality in MindPatch is simulated using rule-based logic to demonstrate ethical and explainable AI behavior.

### Inputs
- User mood score
- Daily screen time
- General time-of-use context

### Logic Rules (Example)
- If mood is low and screen time is high → suggest a longer digital detox break  
- If mood is neutral and screen time is moderate → suggest short mindful breaks  
- If mood is positive → reinforce habits and encourage gratitude journaling

### Outputs
- Personalized detox suggestions shown on the AI Planner screen
- Gentle nudges such as breathing exercises, offline walks, or short screen-free intervals

All AI suggestions are clearly labeled as **AI-generated** and explained in non-technical language.
